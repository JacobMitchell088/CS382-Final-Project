Important!
- For grader. When opening in Unity for the first time, due to the way Unity's built-in player input system works, please delete the PlayerInput script that it tries to auto-create. It can be found in the Assests folder.
- Please note, there is an actual PlayerInput script that can be found in the Assests/Script folder, this is one that works with the code.
